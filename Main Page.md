### About the Main Page {#about_the_main_page}

The wiki is still being developed, so it\'s still quite empty. We are
currently focusing on writing about every project. If we get more
articles about more specific things (Like specific technologies, guides,
etc.), this Main Page will be updated accordingly

### Editing

go ahead and do it. If you want to upload images, you\'ll need to

Discord) Alternatively you could send me the file and I\'ll upload it
then
