- Here's a good site for visualizing the different examples [https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/](https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/) 
**How?**
    
    To make a pasteable config for the site, you must first remove the ant count,
    
    ```
    ##start
    ```
    
    and
    
    ```
    ##end
    ```

    ```
    
    ```
