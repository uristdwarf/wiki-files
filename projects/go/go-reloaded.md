# go-reloaded

This one's really easy or somewhat difficult, depending on how you want to approach this

## Regex approach
Use regex expressions to match certain texts. The go library [has](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp@go1.19.3) built in regular expressions functions. You can learn/practice regular expressions [here](https://regexone.com/) and test your own [here](https://regex101.com/).

## Word-by-word approach
[TODO: Need someone who took this approach to write about it]
