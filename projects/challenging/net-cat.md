![net-cat.gif](/net-cat.gif)
This project consists on recreating the NetCat in a Server-Client
Architecture that can run in a server mode on a specified port listening
for incoming connections, and it can be used in client mode, trying to
connect to a specified port and transmitting information to the server.
