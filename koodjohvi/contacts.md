# Important contacts + communication
test
To make your school life better then you have our kood/Jõhvi team that can help you every step of the way, you just need to ask! The main channel for you to get a fast response is **Discord.** The other way is also to e-mail us at **info@kood.tech**. 

❗If you have a question regarding **IT-problems** or any sort of other complications with audits, 01-platform and so on, then get in touch with **Gervin / kood** on Discord. He's mainly active in the morning from 10.00-12.00 and in the evening 16.00-18.00. Excluding weekends. But don't be afraid to write him anytime and he'll answer you **as soon as possible!**

❗If you have any other questions, problems, suggestions with everyday school life or you just want to have a chat then write to **kood/Jõhvi** on Discord or write to **info@kood.tech.** You'll get an answer **as soon as possible** and if there is something urgent then check who others are active on Discord from the kood/Jõhvi team. 

Keep in mind that weekends are for having a break from the casual work-week for the team! So if we don't answer you during the weekend then don't be affended, we'll get back to you ASAP.
