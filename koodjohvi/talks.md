## Answers from Kristo Vaher's kood/Talk
***When will the "seemless single contact point proactive services" be released? Can I see it in my lifetime? Seems like a something that should be done ASAP.***

Yes! We have targeted to realize about 2-3 seamless proactive services every year and all of the most important ones by 2030 as part of our digital strategy. It will still be slower at first, but you will definitely see all of them take less of your time in that timeframe.

***Why are you not getting more funds for the services? Considering the amount of users and what is offered.***

This is partly political, as you likely have heard and experienced then political climate has been in a bit of a turmoil even prior to COVID-19. I have complete faith in our democratic system, but at times it can get stormy and when the weather is like that, it may be difficult to get additional stuff for funding that general population thinks is good (such as our digital services) and more budgeting goes to hot and critical issues. It is always a bit of a fight, but our current minister has been successful, we have managed to get extra funding for 2022 and this will be a first good step in mitigating the risks of further underfunding.

It is also important to note though that despite financial difficulties, competences are at least just as difficult a problem. Public sector salaries are not competitive with higher end salaries of private sector and while this is perfectly right - public sector work should be a compromise for a better good than financial incentive - it makes it difficult to hire experts for additional help.

***In last reservõppekogunemine many people filled information in internet but still had to fill same data on paper and we ran in the forest to collect the papers and take them to office on time. Why it happens who should take care of the issue?***

Our defence forces are (and in some ways should be) more conservative than innovative startups, so progress of technology, especially internet based access, can be slow. In these days it can be expected that soldiers in the forests carry their mobile phones and have access to internet, but this can be a security risk. There were cases in Russian military, for example, where soldiers were posting "cool photos" of themselves with geotags on them, essentially revealing military training operations that were intended to be secret (this is not an inside info, this was in the media few years back).

As such it can be understood while defence forces takes tech on slightly slower, but they are making strides. In government hackathons (pre-COVID) we actually had military teams participating and writing code to automate military processes and make them faster and more seamless. So it is happening, even if slowly and I am quite proud of the men and women involved that put their effort into achiving tech innovations for our defence forces as well.

***So what would be the optimal cost per month for e-Estonia to become the best it could be without causing outrage about its cost?***

There is no proper number to give, but our minister was hoping for 2% of our government budget to go into digital stuff, which averages out to about 16 EUR per month per citizen.

***Does funding 12€/month include only running costs or also development?***

This is essentially the base funding today, for both maintenance and development that does not need extra funding. As I mentioned we also do some developments for European funding, which is not calculated into this 12/month.

***Has it been calculated how much does every euro spent on digitalizing processes save for the state and an average citizen/person.***

I am sure there have been calculations, but sadly I have nothing concrete to share. It is estimated though that as a result of X-road and data exchange the solution has so far saved 1345 years worth of work effort - in one week. Of course this is a little more complicated and real number is likely smaller, but you can see estimations here: https://www.x-tee.ee/factsheets/EE/

***How much of the digital system of Estonian services is available in open source?***

Not a lot - yet. But it is a strategic goal to open source more solutions over the next few years. Last year we finally got over the bureaucratic hurdle where sharing code was compared to "sharing a coffee cup", so you can imagine how "medieval age" some laws and regulations in a government can be. But software and open software was finally legally defined, making sharing within public sector legally possible with less hurdles.

For code sharing we have set up koodivaramu.eesti.ee, which in some ways is a small effort so far as there are not a lot of repositories available yet, but as I mentioned we are making a stronger push towards it in the next few years, publishing more and assuring better re-use for published solutions.

***Is time and resources necessary to make changes in technical solutions taken into concideration when planning legislative acts and the time of them coming into force?***

Wonderful question, you almost sound like you have public sector blood in your genes somewhere. This is actually one of our biggest problems, this is rarely taken into account (not just in Estonia, but in EU as a whole). We are working on raising awareness of this issue, but it takes time. This starts by making sure that technical people and architects that are responsible for the bigger picture are being involved at the right time where those discussions take place.

***Can working in public sector projects be similar to working in private sector projects in the aspect of being able to switch between projects if you lose interest/motivation in your current project or are there some kind of security boundaries that usually disable this kind of behaviour? Because this is the main reason why I find private sectors more appealing...***

This is another great question. It is true that switching between projects and between administration sectors (such as swithing from one IT development house to another) is pretty rare in terms of how easy it is. Personnel is frequently tied to projects, especially as some of the manpower is direct result of a procurement from private sector. But while it is not as smooth and convenient as in private sector then there are IT development houses (such as SMIT) where this is today a more frequent practice and transitions are smoother. It is definitely in the interest of public sector to retain engineers with domain-awareness and knowledge, since training new personnel is often more expensive - but I do admit that we are lagging behind there compared to private sector where it is a more common practice.
