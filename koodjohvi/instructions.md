# Instructions for students
These instructions will help you to understand how to build a better communication process between students and avoid frustration.
## Intra
Intra is the intranet of kood/Jõhvi, where students can register for the on-site weeks. For now it is in development, so additional feature will arrive pretty soon
## Discord
Discord is not only for fun but also is an important tool for communication between students and kood/Jõhvi team. Also there could be important announcements, so please keep in mind that it is necessary to check the Discord at least once a day at any time.

If for some reason you can not be online, then please let everyone know about it **by writing a short message in your Status**. By doing this, you will be able to let students know when you will be back online, for example for audits (f. e. Online every day from 7PM). If you have any periods where you’re offline, then let people know by updating your status. (f.e. On vacation from 12.10-17.10.)
## Audits
Audits are one of the major parts of the learning process. The more tasks you complete, the more audits should be done. Initially the audit process was designed to be done in place with direct contact with the auditor and the auditee. Due to a lot of the students being offsite, the process changed a bit. To make it more convenient, the 01 team prepared a short example video on how to do an online audition. Video is pinned in the “it-help” channel:

All initial communication should be done by students in Discord before starting the audit.

NB! If the other half of the audit process has not replied **after 24 hours** or refuses to communicate with the other, then the /kood team has authority to handle the case and apply disciplinary action by either contacting the student in person or even banning them for some period of time. This will let you advance in the program. **Write to Gervin/kood on Discord for this.**

## Overall procedure
1. After receiving the audit make the first contact in Discord and arrange a time for the audition process
2. If you are doing the audition offsite, then follow the process described in the video. If onsite, then meet together in of the classrooms
3. If the auditee or auditor is not responding or refuses to communicate after 24 hours, then write to Gervin/kood for assistance

**And remember! If there is no reply after 24 hours and there are no messages left in the Status, then the kood/Jõhvi team will reach out to the person and act according to the outcome. Some of the outcomes include banning from the platform for a certain amount of time.**
